# Project Title

#### A new view for KOReader, based on CoverBrowser.
Project Title is a project by two people who love KOreader but wanted to expand upon the CoverBrowser plugin. We desired an interface that would blend in with the very best that commercial eReaders have. Something that would make the time between books, looking for that next read, as pleasant as possible.

## Features
* **A Speedy Title Bar**: Thinner with more functionality â€” adding Favorites, History, Open Last Book, and Up Folder buttons to help you get exactly where you need as fast as possible.

* **A Fresh Book Listing**: New fonts, new text, new icons for books without covers and unsupported files. An optional progress bar that shows the relative length of each book in lieu of just a raw percentage. Books are presented in a tasteful, distinct manner that adjusts to the screen size and how many items are on screen.

* **A Fitting Folder**: Folders no longer show slashes in their names, and instead are shown with a brand new icon. The arrow to move up a folder has been moved up into the title bar, to give more space for your books.

* **An Informative Footer**: Shows the current folder name as well as the page controls.

* **A Matching Book Status Page**: The default book status page (available as a screensaver) have been updated to show the book's description and your current progress, as well as having its design updated to match the new book listings.

* **A Few Nice Extras**: Autoscan for new books on USB eject, make list and grid items larger or smaller with gestures (pinch/spread), a trophy icon to mark finished books, more here as i remember lol i hope i don't forget to delete this before we publish.

## Who this (hopefully) is for:
* Kobo device owners. We designed this on two Kobos (Aura One, Sage) so we feel pretty confident about the experience there.
* Calibre users. We both sync books using Calibre, and at least one feature (the book-sized progress bars) requires Calibre and a plugin.
* People with tidy EPUB/PDF libraries. We make sure every EPUB we sync has a title, author, series and cover image, so we designed around books always having that metadata.
* Readers who like browsing for their next book and being able to see how long a book is before starting it.

## Who this (probably) is not for:
* Android users. Sorry. We were unable to make it work on Android. We'd love someone to help us, so PRs are very welcome!
* Non-English speakers. Many UI strings were added, some were rewritten and we did not design with an eye toward the localization. PRs welcome here as well, though we prefer to distribute any additional translations with this plugin. Ideally, nothing added to the plugin would ever need a PR against KOReader itself.
* KOReader users who prefer a barebones UI. If you are happy picking your next read from a list of filenames, I don't think you'll like what we're offering. Good news is that KOReader already does this extremely well!
* People who absolutely love one of the features we removed from CoverBrowser. We made this plugin for ourselves, so in additional to adding we also removed things we didn't use. You'll just have to try it out to see if there's anything you miss!
