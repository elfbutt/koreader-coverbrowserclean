# Project Title

#### A new view for KOReader, based on CoverBrowser.

Project Title is a project by two people to take what we liked about the CoverBrowser view in KOReader, make it look less like a terminal-style directory listing, and more like the UI presented by commercial eReaders.

## Features

* **A Speedy Title Bar**: Thinner with more functionality â€” adding Favorites, History, Open Last Book, and Up Folder buttons to help you get exactly where you need as fast as possible.

* **A Fresh Book Listing**: New fonts, new text, new icons for books without covers and unsupported files. An optional [link here] progress bar that shows the relative length of each book in lieu of just a raw percentage. Books are presented in a tasteful, distinct manner.

* **A Fitting Folder**: Folders no longer show slashes in their names, and instead are shown with a brand new icon. The arrow to move up a folder has been moved up into the title bar, to give more space for your books.

* **An Informative Footer**: Shows the current folder name as well as the page controls.

* **A Matching Book Status Page**: The default book status page (available as a screensaver) have been updated to show the book's description and your current progress, as well as having its design updated to match the new book listings.
