# Project Title

#### A new view for KOReader, based on CoverBrowser.

Project Title is a project by two people to take what we already like about the CoverBrowser view in KOReader, make it look less like an OS directory listing, and more like libraries you may see in commercial readers.


## Features

* **A Speedy Title Bar**: Thinner with more functionality, adding Favorites, History, Open Last Book, and Up Folder buttons to help you get exactly where you need as fast as possible.

* **A Fresh Book Listing**: New fonts, new text, a new icon for cover-less books, a new graphical progress meter. Books are presented in a tasteful, distinct manner.

* **A Fitting Folder**: Folders no longer show slashes in their names, and instead are shown with a brand new icon. The up arrow to move up a directory has been moved up into the title bar, to give more space for your books.

* **An Informative Footer**: Shows the current directory name as well as the pagination.

* **A Bonus Book Info Page**: The default book info page and screensaver have been updated to show the book's description and your current progress, as well as having its design updated to match the new book listings.
